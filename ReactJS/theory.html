   <h2>Framework and library difference</h2>
    <p>
Framework: This describes a given structure of "how" you should present your code. Pretty much like a code-template, along some helpers, constructors etc. to solve/simplify a specific problem or bring your architecture in "order". Examples, "Backbone", "requireJS", Angular
 <br>
 <br>
Library: Is an entire toolkit which highly abstracts different layers, like browser's / DOM models / etc. Also as a good toolkit, it offers a lot of tools and neat stuff to work with, which in general, simplify your coding experience. Example "jQuery".

    </p>
    
    <h2>React JS definition:</h2>
    <p>
React is an open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook for building complex, interactive UIs in web and mobile applications. It is often referred to as just the “V” (View) in an “MVC” architecture. Therefore it has no opinions on the other pieces of your technology stack and can be seamlessly integrated into any application.<br>
MERN = Mongodb, Express, React Node js. </p>
<h4>Advantages:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Main advantage: it is lightweight and efficient. React creates its own virtual DOM which gives flexibility and also performance</li> 
<li>Compares DOM to Virtual DOM and only updates what needs to be updated Eg counter App, making it fast and efficient. (add points on immutability )</li>
</ol>
